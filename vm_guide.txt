Small guide to connect to the VM and execute code (please only one at a time)

1. Download a SSH console (PUTTY f.e)
At the host name and saven session you set the "snf-765977.vm.okeanos.grnet.gr".
 You will be asked for a password, it's either
'1234abcd' or 'abcd1234'

2. After you connect use command:
"passwd"
to change your password

3. Every time you connect to execute code you need to run command:
"tmux -S /tmp/shareds attach -t tf"
which will connect you to a strange thing called tmux (google it!) That way even if you disconnect
from the machine, the code will keep running and you can connect at a later time
(either you or someone else) and grab the results

4. To run the code just run the following commands in order:
1. source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate
2. cd sex-drugs-rock-n-roll/
3. python main.py > output/out_<something_unique>.txt
That way you will have the output written to a file rather to the console.

5. At any time you can detach from the tmux console, by using the following shortcut:
ctrl+b d

Keep in mind that no more than one person can use the VM simultaneously. If you connect while someone
else uses the VM, you will see him writing.

Optional:
git br, will reveal the branches
git co <branch_name> will change the branch
git pull will grab the code
